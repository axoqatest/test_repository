	<div><br />  <b>Edited by Tech Dept on Friday, August 24, 2012 at 8:47 AM</b><br id="1345812453540" />  RAS - The 4 9504's have been checked out but not tested as of yet.  Once they are tested I will update there status.  The 2 9506's (109283 &amp; 109287) both failed and will need to to back to Hunter again for repair.  Here is what is wrong with each:
	</div>  
	<div>109283 -  This board has a power to ground short at C145. The cause of this is that U32 was not replaced as stated originally with this NCP.  This Chip needs replacement and then the mod done.
	</div>	
	<div>109287 - The mod for U32 was not done on this board.  This causes there to be no -15v supplied.  Since it was powered up without the mod done as stated eariler this chip needs to be replaced and then the mod performed.
	</div>  
	<div>Both of these boards have been gven to Karen to be sent back to Hunter.

	</b><br id="1361281187755" />  <br />  Three BRD-9504 PCBs must either be scrapped or sent back to Hunter to have U50 re-worked properly on these PCBs.<br />  These, as I recall, are part of the original group of BRD-9504 PCBs that Hunter assembled incorrectly. They oriented U50 wrong. Hunter has had great difficulty re-working this part. The PCB has been modified (Rev C) to change the land areas for U50 and make assembly and re-work easier.<br />  BUT, there have been no issues with the Rev B PCBs when Hunter places the part correctly the first time, so I do not understand why they can't be repaired properly.<br />  <br />

	</b><br />  Regarding the above comments from Hunter:<br />  U50 was not properly soldered when replaced.<br />  There is no easy way of determining if U50 is correctly soldered without active test circuits connected to the PCB.<br />  It appears there may be difficulty in preparing the PCB for the replacement IC and/or aligning the new IC on the PCB. Maybe there is a problem with the part moving as the solder is reflowed, etc.<br />  As stated before, new PCBs do not have the problem of bad solder connections. <br />  <br />
